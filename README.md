# IOS-The-complete-Guide
This repo is for everyone who is new to iOS and wants to learn it properly. It also has lot of reference code which can freely reused by anyone.

iOS or app development in general has been around for some years now. Everyone has their way of doing things and if it works for the usecase then it is fine. However we believe that there are some universally accepted best practices which one should be atleast be aware of if not practicing them in their own dev environment. This repo hopes to define some of the common best practicies and at the same time introduce a beginnner to the world of app development in general and iOS app development in specific. 
I must inform you in advance that I am also in the learning process of these techniques and don't posses complete knowledege of an app development life cycle. This repo started as more of a documentation for me as it was getting difficult for me to keep a track of things while I continue to learn something new everyday in my own dev career as an iOS developer. The point I am trying to make is There can be mistakes or even a more universal way of doing a particular thing than what I might have mentioned in this repo. if you feel it is incomplete or you see a mistake feel free to open a github issue. 

As for the people who are beginning there journey in iOS. I have tried to keep the folder structre as simple as possible going layer by layer part by part in helping you weave through this entangled web (at the start but not later) of iOS app development. If you don't understand a concept or you feel that there is missing something please open a github issue with a TAG  (Enhancement).

I hope this repo comes to help in some shape or form for you guys.

#IOS APPLICATION
ios app development , huh ? what is that ? how do I  start? . these were the questions Even I encountered when I started almost 6 months ago.
if I have to tell you in brief then iOS app is not different from any other app in any other platform. it has a UI you click on things type in something here , select something there, and voila depending on the usecase of the app (more on usecases later) the app will do something. What you have to do as an iOS developer (and I am generalizing here) is take the business requirement(more on how software business works in real world later) and develop an app with a business logic satisfying the requirement. Sounds too much?, looks overwhelming? well it is at the start. Plus proffesional programming is a bit different from hobby or self projects as the requirements for what that app should do change almost at a break neck speed(more on requirements later).

##Parts of an Application
before we move ahead we would like to discuss a very important thing before. The concept of decoupling and orthogonal programming.
when you will start doing the projects present in this repo the first thing which will cross your mind is that the given problem statement should just work. this kind of approach is important as nobody wants an app which does not even do the one things it claimes to be doing.
but at the same time nobody also wants an app which does not do more than just one thing. as your problem statement will increase in complexity managing that one thing that you started with will become difficult. To save us from this Architectures come into the picture.
An Architecture does nothing but simply tell us (the programmers) that which piece of code will do what.



#XCODE
So we have briefly defined what iOS development is. We will go in depth regarding the what part as we proceed. but for now lets define how do I start.
